        <p>This course provides freshmen students with the basic understanding
           of their major. Through class projects it introduces the concepts
           ofinformation technology (IT) and different components of computer-based
           information systems: hardware, software, networks (withadditional emphasis
           on the Internet and web) and databases, as well as engineering approach to 
           system analysis and design.</p>

        <p>As team 40 we have done three homeworks 
           together thus far. Our last project was 
           about learning and applying HTML, CSS, 
           and JavaScript languages. We are assigned 
           to create our very first website. Everyone 
           had their own roles and responsibilities in 
           this project. We had a lot of opportunities to 
           organize meetings to communicate and to solve 
           the problems. In our project, fostering effective 
           collaboration is pivotal. We have implemented 
           several project management tools to streamline 
           communication and task allocation among team members. 
           Leveraging these tools, such as Zoom, Google Meet 
           for real time communication, and of course Github 
           Desktop for tracking the process, ensures seamless 
           collaboration and enhances productivity within our team.</p>
