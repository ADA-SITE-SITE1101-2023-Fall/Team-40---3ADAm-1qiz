        <h1>Our Website project</h1>
        <p>Our first task was to create a website in a short amount of time, 
           which forced us to establish effective teamwork. We got together 
           in an online session to divide up the work so that we could work 
           more efficiently as a team. This made it possible to handle the 
           bi-daily updates needed on GitHub in a more systematic way.
           Having realized that we needed a strong foundation, we enrolled 
           in Codeacademy classes and quickly learned the principles of creating 
           websites. Equipped with our acquired knowledge, we explored the HTML 
           features the following day, shaping the web page's framework and 
           verifying its operation. Notably, we included modest yet effective 
           aspects in our design with the goal of encouraging user involvement.
           The website purposely blurs when users share their ideas and press 
           the enter or submit buttons. A comforting "Thanks for sharing" message 
           appears before the page reloads. By deliberately delays the action, this 
           mimics the information transmission process and gives consumers a sensation 
           of interaction. In an additional effort to improve user experience, the 
           system politely encourages users to enter content if they try to submit 
           without doing so. Hovering over a card in the complex dance of interactivity 
           causes it to change, becoming larger and changing color. Users examining the 
           information on the website will have an immersive experience thanks to this 
           dynamic effect, which adds a layer of visual engagement. We went one step 
           further and added the ability for graphics to grow when the pointer is over 
           a nearby card on page. There is an incorporated strategic link for individuals 
           who are keen to explore the depths of the university. Users are easily taken to 
           the ADA website by clicking on the university's symbol at the bottom of the page. 
           In addition to making browsing easier, this connection provides users with 
           access to a variety of information that expands their understanding of the organization.
           Our allies in creating a network of connectivity across the website were hyperlinks. 
           Hyperlink-enhanced content is highlighted and becomes a different color when 
           the pointer is over the corresponding card. In addition to directing visitors 
           to clickable components, this deliberate visual hint also provides a layer of 
           responsiveness and discreetly acknowledges user activities. Three logos, Facebook, 
           YouTube, and Instagram, at the end of the page invite visitors to check out the 
           university's social media accounts. Every logo acts as a doorway, guiding consumers 
           to the appropriate platforms using simplicity. In addition to improving the website's 
           connectedness, this thoughtful placement satisfies contemporary user expectations by 
           offering easy access to more content and promoting a feeling of community. Our team 
           painstakingly created a website that goes beyond simple information sharing by carefully 
           managing the fine line between form and function. It evolved into an interactive canvas 
           that let users explore, interact, and establish connections. An online experience that 
           surpasses expectations was achieved through the combination of deliberate design decisions, 
           carefully constructed navigational features, and considerate user prompts. This is evidence 
           of our team's dedication to providing exceptional digital storytelling.</p>
