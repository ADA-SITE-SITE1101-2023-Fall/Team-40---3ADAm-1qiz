        <h2>Toghrul Guluzade</h2>
        <p>Hello there! I'm Toghrul, currently embarking 
           on my exciting journey as a first-year Computer 
           Science student at ADA University. The path that 
           led me here is marked by a passion for technology 
           and a series of achievements during my high school 
           years. I delved into the world of competitions, 
           participating in prestigious events such as Teknofest 
           Azerbaijan and Teknofest SAF 2022. These experiences 
           not only honed my skills but fueled my determination 
           to pursue excellence in the realm of computer science.<br>
           Choosing ADA University is the realization of a dream, 
           a place where I can further cultivate my knowledge and 
           skills in a dynamic learning environment. Despite my 
           successes, like anyone starting a new chapter, I've had 
           moments of doubt, wondering if I truly stand among the 
           best of the best. That curiosity and self-reflection have 
           brought me here—to a space where I can connect, learn, 
           and share experiences.<br>
           I'm thrilled to be a part of the ADA community, surrounded 
           by like-minded individuals who share my passion for technology 
           and innovation. As I navigate my way through this academic 
           adventure, I'm eager to embrace challenges, learn from every 
           experience, and contribute to the vibrant tapestry of ADA 
           University. Thank you for joining me on this journey, and I 
           look forward to the exciting discoveries that lie ahead.</p><br>

        <p><h2>Shamil Kazimli</h2><br>My name is Shamil. I am 17 and my major is IT. I am a determined person 
          who wants to fill out my CV with valuable projects and skills and have as many 
          as valuable friends I can during my journey at university. Honestly, I feel 
          very lucky to have such a major since I believe 
          I will obtain most of my goals.<br>
          In preparation for applying to universities, 
                I have undertaken numerous tests and exercises. 
                I have completed the SAT exam and achieved a 
                score of 1430. Additionally, I have taken IELTS 
                and TOEFL English language tests. Moreover, 
                I completed DIM and achieved a score of 606, 
                which was my main achievement for appliying 
                to this university.<br>
                In 2019, I had the opportunity to participate in the 
                <a href="https://socar.az/az/page/socar-uniper-mmc" 
                target= "_blank">Children Exchange Program SOCAR Uniper</a> 
                2019, which was organized by SOCAR and UNIPER. Out of
                hundreds of applicants, I was one of the 20 students selected 
                to participate in this program. Throughout the program, I had 
                the chance to visit various German cities, including Frankfurt, 
                Leverkusen, and Nuremberg etc. Additionally, I participated in 
                different projects and a 12-hour German language course. One of 
                the most memorable parts of the program was visiting tech companies, 
                such as BMW, where I witnessed the development and technology used 
                in that companies. This experience solidified my desire to pursue 
                this field further.</p><br>

        <h2>Araz Valishov</h2>
        <p>Hi, there. I am Araz. I'm excited to explore every opportunity 
          ADA university offers and enter the world of academia. I've decided 
          to pursue a degree in Computer Science. I can't wait to learn new things 
          about my field, have triggering conversations, and make new friends. Outside 
          of the classroom, I'm excited to join clubs related to my interests, whether 
          they be in sports, the arts, or volunteer work. My hobbies are chess and music. 
          Combining these hobbies with my academic pursuits will contribute to a balanced 
          and fulfilling university life. Additionally, one of my goals is to play chess 
          against Ismayil muellim. If he wants to play, here my 
          <a href="https://www.chess.com/stats/overview/moriarti9?">Chess.com</a> account. If that 
          opportunity arises, it could be an incredible experience, allowing me to test my 
          skills against an experienced chess player (National Master) and potentially learn 
          valuable lessons from the game. That’s it. I will keep nurturing my  passions, pursuing 
          my goals, and embracing every aspect of the academic journey at ADA University.</p>

        <h2>Laman Ahmadova</h2>
        <p>Hi there! As a first-year student in computer engineering, 
          I'm Laman, a 17-year-old starting this exciting path. Imagine 
          a world in which logical and creative lines of code can do 
          anything you wish. That's where I'm at. I have a strong desire 
          to understand the complexity of circuits and algorithms in 
          the field of technology. I'm fascinated by how hardware and 
          software interact to create the digital world because I'm an 
          enthusiast for computer engineering. I always have a great 
          desire to explore the exciting and always changing world of 
          technology, whether it is by designing a beautiful application 
          or playing around with the newest devices. In between the circuit 
          schematics and binary codes, you'll find my more tender side—a 
          deep affection for cats. I hold a particular place in my heart for 
          these mysterious animals, and I take comfort in their loving yet 
          independent demeanor. My favorite thing to do when I'm not lost 
          in the virtual world of programming is curling up with a book and 
          a purring kitty by my side. Apart from technology, I have a wide 
          range of interests. My constant companion is philosophy, which 
          gives me a prism through which to view the more profound concerns 
          of existence and the moral implications of scientific advances. 
          It's the ideal diversion from the logical accuracy of coding, a 
          field that emphasizes abstract concepts and critical thinking.</p>
