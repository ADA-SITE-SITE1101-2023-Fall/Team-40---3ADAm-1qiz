        <h2>What is Hour of Code</h2>
        <p>Hour of Code is a global event dedicated to teach students how coding functions.
          It is an event that takes place annually during the second week of December. Usually 
          this event lasts about an hour and here participant are encouraged to do some basic coding 
          activities. The prominent goal is to demonstrate that anyone can learn fundamentals of coding, and 
          to increase interest in computer science.</p><br>

        <h2>Our Hour of Code event</h2>
        <p>We chose Baku Turkish Anatolian High School to evaluate the Code of Hour activity. In Azerbaijan, our 
          compatriots, and citizens of Türkiye study in the school that is affiliated to the MNE (Ministry of 
          National Education). This school, unfortunately, has a stereotype that there is no good university in 
          Azerbaijan, which was the main reason we chose this school. The staff of the school welcomed us with 
          a smile and support. The principal’s assistant helped us choose the class, and we chose the 7E class 
          since it was the most suitable for us. Thirty-four children participated in our event, and it was very 
          dynamic. Schoolers listened attentively to us, and they showed interest in greeting us warmly.</p><br>

        <h2>Suprising Outcomes for the Kids</h2>
        <p>On the very first day we started, we designed certificates. We entrusted this to Toghrul, who is 
          engaged in design in our team. We decided to design the certificates in two different cases. One 
          was a general attendance certificate, and this was given to everyone. Another five special certificates 
          were prepared and given to participants who attended the coding part. . The children were delighted by 
          the presents we brought a rocket model, notebooks, stickers, and other school supplies. They were 
          particularly fascinated by our rocket model. </p>
